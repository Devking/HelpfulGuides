[Install Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

```
# Update brew
brew update

# To install the `node` package
brew install node

# Upgrade to the latest node version
# Run brew update first
brew upgrade node
```

If you installed node using brew, upgrade using brew.

Don't mix brew with installing manually or via other package managers.
